The overfitting is caused when we select a complex model given less amount of data.
It can be identified when training accuracy is very good but prediction on unseen data is poor.

It can be tackled with

1) Reduce the number of features:
  Manually select which features to keep.
  Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).

2) Regularization
Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters (feature coefficients)
Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.
