# 100daysofml

Repo of various aspects/tools/techniques/programming concepts related to Data Science and Machine learning. 

Everyday 1 file of code or learning summary will be added to this repo.

This repo will focus on Python 3 for data analysis and machine learning along with some other tools as and when explored.

The repo will also talk about machine learning techniques in brief, followed by data science courses, projects and Hackathons.

All files are made/edited in Jupyter notebook.
Currently available files in this repo:

Day1- Hands on Numpy library: This file focuses on very simple and basic operations on arrays using numpy library (the exercises are taken from https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/)

Day2- Hands on Pandas library: basic and essential exercises on pandas library (to be updated)

Day3- Data pre-processing: the essential step before model building

Day4- Descriptive analysis:  to understand the nature of data using plots

Day5- Feature Engineering: step to transform, augment or generate new features out of existing features 

Day6- Modeling: predicting response variable with predictors with simple ML algorithms.

Day7- Logistic regression for two class and multi-class

Day8- Decision Tree and RandomForest
